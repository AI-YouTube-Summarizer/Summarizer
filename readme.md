### Clipboard Functionality Setup for Different Operating Systems

This project uses clipboard functionality for copying summaries directly to the clipboard. Depending on your operating system, follow the instructions below to ensure proper setup.

#### **For Linux**
The app uses `xclip` to enable clipboard functionality on Linux systems.

1. **Install xclip**:  
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install xclip
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:  
   Test if `xclip` is installed by running:
   ```bash
   echo "Clipboard test" | xclip -selection clipboard
   ```
   Paste the clipboard content (e.g., in a text editor) to confirm.

3. **Run the App**:  
   Ensure that `xclip` is accessible in your environment, and the app will use it for clipboard operations automatically.

#### **For Windows**
The app uses `pyperclip` for clipboard functionality on Windows systems.

1. **Install pyperclip**:  
   Run the following command to install `pyperclip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pyperclip
   ```

2. **Verify Clipboard Support**:  
   Pyperclip works seamlessly on Windows without additional dependencies. Run this Python snippet to test:
   ```python
   import pyperclip
   pyperclip.copy("Clipboard test")
   print(pyperclip.paste())
   ```

3. **Run the App**:  
   The app will automatically use `pyperclip` on Windows for clipboard operations.

---

#### **Code Behavior**
The app detects the operating system and uses the appropriate library for clipboard operations. You donâ€™t need to configure anything manually beyond ensuring `xclip` (Linux) or `pyperclip` (Windows) is installed.

---

### Example Usage
1. Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button in the app.
2. A notification will appear, confirming the text is copied to your clipboard.
3. Paste the copied content into any text editor (e.g., `Ctrl + V` or `Cmd + V`).

---

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Paste the YouTube video URL.
3. Select the desired summary language.
4. Generate the default summary or request customized summaries using the chatbot.
5. Download or copy the summary as needed.
